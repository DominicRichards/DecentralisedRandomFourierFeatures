# DecentralisedRandomFourierFeatures
Pytorch implementation of Decentralised Random Fourier Feature Regression using Distributed Gradient Descent

This code is to accompany the manuscript "Decentralised Learning with Random Features and Distributed Gradient Descent" (2020) by D. Richards, P. Rebeschini and L. Rosasco (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00360).
The code is an implementation of Decentralised Random Fourier Feature Regression on the SUSY dataset using Distributed Gradient Descent.
