# Decentralised Random Fourier Feature Regression

This code is to accompany the manuscript "Decentralised Learning with Random Features and Distributed Gradient Descent" (2020) by D. Richards, P. Rebeschini and L. Rosasco (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00360).
The code is an implementation of Decentralised Random Fourier Feature Regression on the SUSY dataset using Distributed Gradient Descent. It utilises Pytorch to perform the main matrix-vector multiplications, and thus, can utilise a GPU for speed-up.
